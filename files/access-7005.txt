NOTES
“Picture postcards helped spread information about [Maine’s] beauty and points of interest, and it was a Portland man who first brought such postcards to the United States.”

Adam Philips Leighton went to work at Chisholm Brothers, a book store on Congress Street in Portland, Maine on November 19, 1867 for $5 a week. In 1868 he was sent to the Grand Trunk railway station to take charge of the newsboys at the Chisholm railroad office. The Chisholms began to enlarge their book and news business on the railroad. “They now control business on a dozen roads, and were pioneers in introducing a great many of the best-selling publications. For years they furnished newsdealers and jobbers from the Atlantic to the Pacific with view-books...” and published their first postcard in 1888. 

The Chisholm company had long specialized in view books illustrated first with lithographs and then with black-and-white photographs. Familiar with pictorial postcards used in Europe, Leighton purchased sheets of one-cent postals from the government and had single-colored pictures put on the side not reserved for an address. The first were in 1888. He later had others printed in Germany. They bore the Chisholm company name. Adam eventually began to publish postcards under his own name and built the new enterprise into a substantial business.

The 1898 act [of Congress, which limited postcard stock to that provided by the government] led to the issuing of more pictorial cards by a wider number of companies, and many were published in the United States, both in color and in black (or sepia) and white. American printers, including the newer firms working in Maine, were aided by the 1910 tariff, which raised prices of imported cards, so that even the Leighton firm, now directed by Hugh C. Leighton, changed tactics and joined with a New York company to print postcards in the United States. The quality of those pictures was lower, as were colorful cards from other American companies. Some were not even photographs but were drawings made from photographs.”

In 1907, postcards were allowed to have divided backs, with half to be used for a message.

Adam Philips Leighton was born to Adam and Julia Ann (Leighton) Leighton on April 6, 1851 in West Falmouth, Maine. Adam married Isadore Mary Butler (b. 1852), daughter of Alonzo and Mary (Dodge) Butler of Portland on June 30, 1873.

Adam Leighton was elected mayor of Portland, Maine three times. In 1902 he built an impressive home on the Western Promenade in Portland.

Hugh Chisholm Leighton was born to Adam Philips and Isadore Mary (Butler) Leighton on October 28, 1878 in Portland, Maine. He graduated from Williams College in 1902 and married Elizabeth Foster Wilcox (b. September 1887) on November 17, 1908 in Janesville, Rock, Wisconsin. Hugh Chisholm Leighton died on January 6, 1943.
